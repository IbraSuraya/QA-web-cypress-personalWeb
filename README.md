## About
---
- This project is based on following a <a href="https://buildwithangga.com/kelas/complete-beginner-qa-engineer-e2e-testing-with-cypress?main_leads=searchsuggestion" target="_blank">BWA</a> course titled QA-E2E-Cypress.
- The tested website is the property of the course, so it cannot be attached.
- The tests carried out consist of manual tests [Docs Testing] and automation tests with the cypress tool.
- Although this was the result of the course, the project was developed further. The test documentation was made more detailed by following many industry standard references.

- Automation tests were created by adjusting the clean code format and adding several new scenarios.
